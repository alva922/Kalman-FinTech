Noise-Resistant Kalman Filter Moving Average (KMA) vs SMA Crossover Algo-Trading Strategies: BAC Showcase
Most technical trading indicators (TTI) derived from historical stock data are used by traders to predict future price trend reversals and make trading decisions.
It is widely accepted that financial market predictions are a very challenging task due to the high level of time-varying market noise that distorts the picture of the underlying trend and seasonal periodicity.
In algo-trading, technical analysis always relies on identifying patterns and signals, but these can sometimes be misleading if (signal/noise)<1.
Indeed, spurious price fluctuations and false breakouts can result in false TTI signals, compromising risk-return optimization and leading to poor trading strategies.
In this project, weâ€™ll address the aforementioned shortcomings of TTI by using the Kalman Filter (KF) that provides noise-resistant probabilistic estimates of hidden variables based on inaccurate and uncertain time series data.
